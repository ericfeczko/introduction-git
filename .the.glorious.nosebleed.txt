She wandered among the trees Aimlessly.
The creature regarded them Balefully.
The pudding was served Clumsily.
They played whist Distractedly.
She knitted mufflers Endlessly.
They searched the cellars Fruitlessly.
She danced on the sands Giddily.
He looked out the window Hopelessly.
He fell of the pier Inadvertently.
She toyed with her beads Jadedly.
They got themselves up Killingly.
He exposed himself Lewdly.
He ran through the hall Maniacally.
He sat in the train Numbly.
The doorbell rand Ominously.
It was in the trunk Presumably.
She let go of it Quickly.
He spoke to the child Repressively.
He disposed of the fragments Slyly.
She ran out of the room Tearfully.
He explained himself Unconvincingly.
She appeared on the roof Vapourously.
He struck her down Willfully.
The piece was sung eXcruciatingly.
She watched him go Yearningly.
He wrote it all down Zealously.
